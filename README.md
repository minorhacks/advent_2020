# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my attempts at the Advent of Code 2020 challenges. I
am completing these challenges while:

* Learning Rust
* Organizing the code to allow for unit testing/benchmarking
* Replacing loops with iterators and their higher-order FPP functions

## Getting Started

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

1. Clone this repository and `cd` to it

1. Run all tests:

   ```
   cargo test
   ```

1. Run binary for a specific day (`day_04` in this example):

   ```
   cargo run --bin=day_04
   ```
